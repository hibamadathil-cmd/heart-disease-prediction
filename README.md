## 📖 Overview

Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of death globally, yet early detection dramatically improves patient outcomes. Traditional clinical diagnosis often relies on multiple tests and expert judgement — which may not be accessible in resource-limited settings.

This project builds a **binary ML classifier** that predicts whether a patient has heart disease based on **13 clinical attributes**, enabling fast, data-driven preliminary screening. It demonstrates a complete ML pipeline — from raw data all the way to a live deployed web application.

## 🔬 ML Pipeline — Full Life Cycle

### 🔹 Stage 1 — Problem Definition &nbsp;
Framed the problem as a **binary classification** task. Defined success metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score), identified the clinical domain context, and reviewed existing literature on ML-based cardiac risk prediction.

### 🔹 Stage 2 — Data Collection & Understanding &nbsp;
Sourced the Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset (303 records, 14 columns). Conducted initial profiling: data types, null counts, statistical summaries, and preliminary class balance checks.

### 🔹 Stage 3 — Data Preprocessing & Cleaning &nbsp;
- Verified and handled missing or erroneous values
- Standardised numerical features using `StandardScaler`
- Encoded categorical variables appropriately
- Performed **80/20 stratified train/test split**
- Persisted processed splits as `.pkl` files under `data/`

### 🔹 Stage 4 — Exploratory Data Analysis &nbsp;
Conducted across `EDA.ipynb` and `EDA_cleaned.ipynb`:
- Age and target class distribution
- Correlation heatmap across all 13 features
- Boxplots for outlier detection in numerical variables
- Gender and chest-pain-type breakdowns

### 🔹 Stage 5 — Feature Engineering & Selection &nbsp;
Applied two statistical methods to identify the most clinically significant features:

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Mutual Information** | Captures non-linear feature–target dependencies |
| **Chi-Square Test** | Assesses categorical feature–target associations |

**Top 4 selected features:**

| # | Feature | Clinical Meaning |
|---|---------|-----------------|
| 1 | `cp` | Chest Pain Type |
| 2 | `thalach` | Maximum Heart Rate Achieved |
| 3 | `ca` | Number of Major Vessels (fluoroscopy) |
| 4 | `thal` | Thalassemia / Blood Flow Classification |

### 🔹 Stage 6 — Model Building & Training &nbsp;
Three models were trained and compared on the cleaned, scaled dataset:

| Model | Approach |
|-------|---------|
| **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** | Tuned with optimal `k` via cross-validation |
| **Logistic Regression** | L2 regularisation |
| **Gradient Boosting** | Ensemble tree-based method |

### 🔹 Stage 7 — Model Evaluation & Comparison &nbsp;

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| 🏆 **KNN** | **81.97%** | 77.50 | 93.94 | 84.93 |
| Logistic Regression | 80.33% | 76.92 | 90.91 | 83.33 |
| Gradient Boosting | 81.91% | 78.95 | 90.91 | 84.51 |

> KNN was selected as the **production model** based on highest accuracy. Confusion matrices and decision boundary plots are available in `plots/`.

### 🔹 Stage 8 — Model Interpretation & Explainability &nbsp;
- Decision boundary plots generated for KNN and Logistic Regression
- Feature importance visualised via Mutual Information and Chi-Square scores
- Findings documented to ensure **clinical transparency** of predictions

### 🔹 Stage 9 — Deployment &nbsp;
The KNN model (`heart_model.pkl`) and scaler (`scaler.pkl`) were serialised with `joblib` and deployed via **Streamlit**:
- Interactive sidebar for entering all 13 patient parameters
- Real-time prediction with risk classification output
- Clinical cyberpunk UI theme with animated feedback

### 🔹 Stage 10 — Documentation &nbsp;
- Maintained structured Jupyter notebooks for all pipeline stages
- Authored this README and project PPT
- Organised GitHub repository with branches: `main`, `feature/eda`, `feature/feature-selection`, `ml-models`

## 📊 Results Summary

| Metric | 🏆 KNN (Production) | Logistic Regression | Gradient Boosting |
